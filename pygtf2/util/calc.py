    """
    Computes central density of system at smallest non-zero radial point.

    Arguments
    ---------
    rmid : ndarray, shape (s, N)
        Midpoint radii per species.
    rho : ndarray, shape (s, N)
        Shell densities per species.

def mass_fraction_radii(r_edges, m_edges, fracs):
    """
    Compute radii at which a given set of mass fractions of the total enclosed mass are reached.

    Parameters
    ----------
    r_edges : array_like, shape (N,)
        Radii of the radial edges (grid points). Expected to be monotonic (typically increasing).
    m_edges : array_like, shape (N,)
        Cumulative (enclosed) mass evaluated at each radius in ``r_edges``.
        The final element ``m_edges[-1]`` is interpreted as the total mass of the species.
    fracs : array_like, shape (M,)
        Mass fractions of the total mass at which the radius is requested (typically in [0, 1]).
        Can be any real values; see Notes for behavior outside the nominal range.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray, shape (M,)
        Array of radii corresponding to each requested mass fraction in ``fracs``.
        If the total mass (``m_edges[-1]``) is <= 0, an array of NaNs with the same shape as ``fracs`` is returned.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the input arrays have incompatible lengths or if ``m_edges`` and ``r_edges`` do not have at least two points.
        (The implementation assumes at least two edges for meaningful interpolation.)

    Notes
    -----
    - The function computes target enclosed masses as ``fracs * m_tot`` where ``m_tot = m_edges[-1]`` and finds the interval
      in ``m_edges`` that brackets each target. It then linearly interpolates in radius between the two bracketing edges.
    - The search advances monotonically through the mass-edge array for successive targets (amortized O(N + M) cost),
      so performance is best when ``fracs`` are provided in non-decreasing order. The function still works for unsorted ``fracs``.
    - The routine assumes ``m_edges`` is non-decreasing and corresponds to the same ordering as ``r_edges``. No internal sorting is performed.
    - Behavior for targets outside the range of ``m_edges``:
      - Targets >= total mass map to ``r_edges[-1]``.
      - Targets less than the first edge mass are handled by linear interpolation using the first interval and may produce radii
        smaller than ``r_edges[0]`` (i.e., backward extrapolation).
    - Exact matches to an edge mass return the corresponding edge radius.
